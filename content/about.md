Hi, I'm Alessandro Sartori an italian full stack developer.

A fan of programming and electronics since my first studies.

I'm always looking for new technologies and I'm fascinated by software automation and their use starting from home to industrial use.

I'm a supporter of android, linux and anything that allows me to get my hands under the hood.

I have a decent collection of Arduino, Raspberry and ARM microcontrollers that I'm very proud of, and recently I'm also playing with 3D printing.
